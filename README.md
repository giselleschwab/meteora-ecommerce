## About the Project
This project was developed during the 7th edition of the Alura Front-End Challenge. The challenge consisted of creating a complete e-commerce site for the fictional brand "Meteora."

I chose to build the project using the React.js library, styled with CSS modules, and included Bootstrap to assist in creating the carousel and modals.

## API Mock
During the project's development, I opted to create a [Mock API](https://github.com/giselleschwab/api-meteora) for the products and categories. This simulation of a REST API was created to provide the necessary data for categories and products displayed on the Front-End of the application. This approach was chosen to allow working with fictional data during development and facilitate the implementation of functionalities.

## Features
The Meteora E-commerce has the following features:

1. Filtering and Search: Users can filter products by categories by selecting the corresponding icons in the categories section. Additionally, it's possible to search for products by name.

2. Product Details: When clicking the "View More" button on a product, a modal opens, presenting a detailed description of the product, its price, and available options such as colors and sizes.

3. Newsletter: The page includes a Newsletter section where users can sign up by providing their emails. After registration, a success modal is displayed for valid emails, while invalid emails show a modal with an error message.

4. Responsiveness: The site is responsive to facilitate purchases from any mobile device.
